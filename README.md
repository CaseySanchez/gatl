# GATL: Geometric Algebra Template Library
GATL is a C++ library for Euclidean, homogeneous/projective, Mikowski/spacetime, conformal, and arbitrary [geometric algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra).

Geometric algebra is a powerful mathematical system encompassing many mathematical concepts (*e.g.*, [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number), [quaternions algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion_algebra), [Grassmann-Cayley algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmann%E2%80%93Cayley_algebra), and [Pl√ºcker coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates)) under the same framework. Geometric algebra is mainly based on the algebraic system called [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra), but with a strong emphasis on geometric interpretation. In geometric algebra, subspaces are treated as primitives for computation. As such, it is an appropriate mathematical tool for modeling and solving geometric problems in physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science.

GATL uses template meta-programming to implement the [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) strategy. This way, GATL is capable of performing some optimizations on the program at compile time. In other words, GATL is designed to automatically execute low-level algebraic manipulation in the procedures described by the users with geometric algebra operations, leading to more efficient programs.

## 1. Requirements
Make sure that you have the following tools before attempting to use GATL.

Required tool:
- Your favorite [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14) compiler.

Optional tool:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) to automate installation and to build and run examples and unit-tests.

Optional C++ library:
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) to build and run unit-tests.

GATL doesn't have any dependencies other than the [C++ standard library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header).


## 2. How to "Install" GATL
GATL is a pure template library defined in the headers. Therefore, if you just want to use GATL, you can use the header files right away. There is no binary library to link to and no configured header file.

Use the [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command to download the project, where `<gatl-dir>` must be replaced by the directory in which you want to place GATL's source code, or removed `<gatl-dir>` from the command line to download the project to the `./gatl` directory:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/laffernandes/gatl.git <gatl-dir>
```

The directory `<gatl-dir>/cpp/include` must be in the include path of your program, *i.e.*, you have to use the `-I<gatl-dir>/cpp/include` option flag while compiling your program. Alternatively, you can use CMake to copy GATL's header files to the common include directory in your system (*e.g.*, `/usr/local/include`, in Linux) in order to avoid the use of the `-I<gatl-dir>/cpp/include` option flag. The basic steps for installing GATL using CMake look like this in Linux:
```bash
$ cd <gatl-dir>/cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```


## 3. Compiling Examples
The basic steps for configuring and building GATL examples look like this in Linux:
```bash
$ cd <gatl-dir>/cpp/tools/example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

Recall that `<gatl-dir>` is the directory in which you placed GATL's source code.

Assuming a makefile generator was used, the examples are build using:
```bash
$ make -j8
```

The executable files produced by the `make` command start with `gatl_example_`.


## 4. Compiling and Running Unit-Tests
Unit-tests are under construction. Please, don't try to build them.


## 5. Documentation
Here you find a brief description of the namespaces, macros, classes, functions, procedures, and operators available for the user. The detailed documentation is not ready yet.

According to GATL conventions, in the following definitions, `lhs` and `rhs` are informal shorthand for, respectively, the left-hand side and the right-hand side arguments of some procedure. In addition, the `mtr` argument must be an instance of the `metric_space<...>` class, while all other arguments can be either an instances of the `clifford_expression<...>` class or other numerical types (*e.g.*, `double`, `float`, `int`, or instances of third-party classes). Numerical types are automatically converted by GATL to scalar Clifford expression using the `scalar` function.

### Namespaces
Namespaces are declarative regions that provide scope to the names of the types, function, variables, *etc.*, inside it. GATL defines the following namespaces.

| Namespace | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ga` | The main namespace that encloses all GATL implementations |
| `ga1e`, `ga2e`, `ga3e`, `ga4e`, `ga5e` | The namespace of Euclidean geometric algebra of R<sup>*n*</sup> |
| `ga1h`, `ga2h`, `ga3h`, `ga4h` | The namespace of homogeneous/projective geometric algebra of R<sup>*d*</sup> (*n* = *d* + 1) |
| `ga1m`, `ga2m`, `ga3m` | The namespace of Mikowski/spacetime algebra of R<sup>*d*</sup> (*n* = *d* + 2) |
| `ga1c`, `ga2c`, `ga3c` | The namespace of conformal geometric algebra of R<sup>*d*</sup> (*n* = *d* + 2) |

The namespaces of specific geometric algebras (*e.g.*, `ga3e`, `ga3h`, `ga3m`, and `ga3c`) already use the `ga` namespace. In addition, they overload all metric operations presented in the following section by setting the `mtr` argument according to their respective spaces.

All above-mentioned namespaces declare a nested `detail` namespace. This is the namespace where the magic happens. Don't touch it!

According to the GATL conventions, the root directory for the header files that you will include in your program is the `gatl` folder. Also, the header file for each namespace is its name followed by the `.hpp` expression. Putting both conventions together, we have `gatl/ga.hpp`, `gatl/ga3e.hpp`, `gatl/ga3h.hpp`, `gatl/ga3m.hpp`, `gatl/ga3c.hpp`, and so on.


### Macros
Optionally, set the following macros before including GATL headers in your program in order to change some conventions of the library.

| `GA_DEFAULT_INTEGRAL_TYPE` | Defines the signed integral type assumed as default by the library (default is `std::int64_t`) |
| `GA_MAX_BASIS_VECTOR_INDEX` | Defines the maximum number of basis vectors assumed while performing algebraic manipulations and setting the size of bitsets (default is `63`) |


### Classes and Data Types
The following basic data types are defined in order to assign a meaning to conventional types, like `double`, `int`, and so on.

| `bitset_t` | The bitset type used by the library (uses `GA_MAX_BASIS_VECTOR_INDEX` to select the smallest unsigned integral type capable to meet implementation requirements) |
| `grade_t` | The signed integral type used to represent grade values  (same as `default_integral_t`) |
| `index_t` | The unsigned integral type used to represent the index of basis vectors (set to `std::uint64_t`) |

### Overloaded Operators
GATL overload some C++ operators with the aim of making the writing of source code closer to the writing of mathematical expressions with geometric algebra.

It is important to notice that the precedence and associativity of C++ operators are different than the one assumed in mathematical functions. For instance, one would expect that the outer/wedge product `^` would be evaluated before the addition operation in the following expression `a + b ^ c`, because product precedes addition in math. However, in C++ the addition operator (`+`) precedes the bitwise XOR operator (`^`), leading to possible mistakes while implementing mathematical procedures (please, refer to the [C++ specification](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence) for details). As a result, the resulting expression in this example would be `(a + b) ^ c`. The use of parenthesis is strongly recommended in order to avoid those mistakes. By rewriting the example, `a + (b ^ c)` will guarantee the expected behavior.

| Arithmetic Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+rhs` | Unary plus |
| `-rhs` | Unary minus |
| `lhs + rhs` | Addition |
| `lhs - rhs` | Subtraction |
| `lhs * rhs` | Geometric/Clifford product (same as `gp(lhs, rhs)`) |
| `lhs / rhs` | Inverse geometric/Clifford product (same as `igp(lhs, rhs)`) |
| `lhs ^ rhs` | Outer/Wedge product (same as `op(lhs, rhs)`) |
| `lhs < rhs` | Left constraction (same as `lcont(lhs, rhs)`) |
| `lhs > rhs` | Right constraction (same as `rcond(lhs, rhs)`) |
| <code>lhs &#124; rhs</code> | Dot product (same as `dot(lhs, rhs)`) |

| Input/Output Operator | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `os << arg` | Insert formatted output (it uses the `write` function) |
